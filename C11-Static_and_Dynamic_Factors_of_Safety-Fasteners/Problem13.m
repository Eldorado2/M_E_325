% RB&W11 recommends turn-of-nut from snug ﬁt to preload as follows: 1/3 
% turn for bolt grips of 1–4 diameters, 1/2 turn for bolt grips 4–8 
% diameters, and 2/3 turn for grips of 8–12 diameters. These 
% recommendations are for structural steel fabrication (permanent joints), 
% producing preloads of 100 percent of proof strength and beyond. Machinery 
% fabricators with fatigue loadings and possible joint disassembly have 
% much smaller turns-of-nut. The RB&W recommendation enters the nonlinear 
% plastic deformation zone. The figure shows a cross section of a grade 25 
% cast-iron pressure vessel, with a torque factor K of 0.09. Use Eq. (8–27) 
% to estimate the torque necessary to establish the desired preload given 
% that preload Fi = 14.4 kip, bolt stiffness kb = 5.21 × 106 lbf/in, number 
% of threads N = 11, and material stiffness km = 8.95 × 106 lbf/in.

% Determine the torque necessary to establish the desired preload and the 
% turn of the nut in degrees.
