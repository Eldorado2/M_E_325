%%%%% Problems 1-2 %%%%%
% A countershaft is supported by two tapered roller bearings using an 
% indirect mounting. The radial bearing loads are 560 lbf for the left-hand 
% bearing and 1095 for the right-hand bearing. An axial load of 200 lbf is 
% carried by the left bearing. The shaft rotates at 480 rev/min and is to 
% have a desired life of 31 kh. Use an application factor of 1.4 and a 
% combined reliability goal of 0.93, assuming distribution data from 
% manufacturer 1 in Table 11–6. Using an initial K = 1.5, find the required 
% radial rating for each bearing. Select the bearings from Fig. 11–15.

% Problem 1
% What are the induced loads at each of the bearings, the design life 
% ratio, xD, and the required reliability for each bearing?
