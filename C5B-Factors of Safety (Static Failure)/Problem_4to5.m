%%%%% Problems 4 to 5 %%%%%
% A solid round bar with a diameter of 1.63 in has a groove cut to a 
% diameter of 1.468 in, with a radius of 0.082 in. The bar is not rotating. 
% The bar is loaded with a repeated bending load that causes the bending 
% moment at the groove to fluctuate between 0 and 25,000 lbfÂ·in. The bar is 
% hot-rolled AISI 1095, but the groove has been machined. Determine the 
% factor of safety for fatigue based on infinite life using the modified 
% Goodman criterion and the factor of safety for yielding.

% Moment of inertia
I = (pi*d^4)/64; % in^4

% Nominal bending stress

                 - 3.08*(10^-3)*S_ut ...
                 + 1.51*(10^-5)*S_ut^2 ...

% Find the notch sensitivity
q = 1/(1 + neuber_bending/sqrt(r));

% Fatigue stress concentration factor:
K_f = 1 + q*(K_t - 1);

stress_max = K_f * stress_nom_max; % kpsi

% Calculate Marin Factors

% For the surface factor, k_a, the groove is machined
a_surface = 2;
b_surface = -0.217;

k_a = a_surface*S_ut^b_surface;

% For the size factor, k_b, the bar is in bending and is not rotating
